Weather App 
---------------------------
Here is my attempt to create a weather website for today's weather and a 5 day forecast.
I was able to get the api info, and most of the code for targeting specific classes and id's in the DOM.
I was able to display a towns weather by using the zip code, howver I had to hardcode it in the url.
I was unable to get the search button to successfully pull up a city's weather by userinput.
I was unable to display the five day forecast below the main forecast card. 
I didn't have the opportunity to finish the CSS. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I made a js file called proto.js to test simpler concepts of the main code in order to undertsand
and get certain aspects of the code to work. Unfortunately I do not have the time to finish this project as I would've liked.
